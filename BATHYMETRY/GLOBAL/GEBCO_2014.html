<p>The General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) consists of an international group of experts who work on the development of a range of bathymetric data sets and data products, with the aim of providing the most authoritative, publicly available bathymetric data sets for the world's oceans.
</p> 
<p>GEBCO operates under the joint auspices of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO.
</p> 
<p>This document provides information on GEBCO's latest gridded product, the GEBCO_2014 Grid.

<h3 id="1_intro">1. Introduction &mdash; The GEBCO_2014 Grid
</h3> 
<p>The GEBCO_2014 Grid is a continuous terrain model for ocean and land with a spatial resolution of 30 arc seconds. It is an updated version of the GEBCO_08 Grid.
</p> 
<p>The GEBCO_08 Grid was first published in January 2009. The bathymetric portion of the grid was developed from a database of ship track soundings with interpolation between soundings guided by satellite-derived gravity data.
</p> 
<p>Since its initial release, the GEBCO community has been working on updating this data set. Where they improve on this 'base grid', data sets generated by other methods have been included.
</p> 
<p>Recognising the importance of local expertise when building a global bathymetric grid, GEBCO has been working with regional mapping groups to improve its global bathymetric model. This release of the grid benefits from collaborations with a number of regional groups. Further details can be found in 
<a href='#Annex_A' target="_self">Annex A
</a> and on our regional mapping web pages:
<a href='http://www.gebco.net/regional_mapping/mapping_projects/'>www.gebco.net/regional_mapping/mapping_projects/
</a> 
</p> 
<p>Details on the development of the grid are given below along with information on its update history.
</p>

<h3 id="2_grid">2. Grid development
</h3> 
<p>The GEBCO grid, called 'GEBCO_08', was originally derived from v5.0 of the SRTM30_plus data set
<sup>3
</sup>, released in 2008. This grid was produced by combining the published Smith and Sandwell global topographic grid between latitudes 80&deg; N and 81&deg; S (version 11.1, September, 2008) with a database of over 290 million bathymetric soundings.
</p> 
<p>Within the Smith and Sandwell global topographic grid, the predicted depths are based on version V16.1 of the Sandwell and Smith gravity anomaly from Geosat and ERS 1 satellite altimetry, created in March 2007.
</p> 
<p>The original GEBCO_08 Grid was developed as a collaborative effort by the following organisations
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO)
</li> 
<li>International Hydrographic Bureau (IHB)
</li> 
<li>The US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA)
</li> 
<li>The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
</li> 
<li>The US Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVO)
</li> 
<li>Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO)
</li> 
<li>The UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)
</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Bathymetric sounding data sets and compilation grids of measured bathymetry from a number of sources were used to generate the base grid, including
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Bathymetric soundings from the GEODAS
<sup>10
</sup> data set maintained by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) Data Center for Digital Bathymetry (DCDB) at the US National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC).
</li> 
<li>Bathymetric grids and data files from the marine geology and geophysics community, including contributions from the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) Ridge Multibeam Synthesis Project, GEOMAR, National Science Foundation (NSF) Polar Programs, the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and the WHOI/GLOBEC programme.
</li> 
<li>Swath bathymetry grids from Scripps Institution of Oceanography multibeam cruises.
</li> 
<li>Multibeam grids contributed by the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC)
<sup>16
</sup>.
</li> 
<li>The US National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) Coastal Relief Model
<sup>6
</sup>.
</li> 
<li>Multibeam grids from &quot;Law of the Sea&quot; work for areas around Alaska and the Arctic, the Marianas, Kingman Reef and Palmyra Atoll, the Western Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico from the Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center at the University of New Hampshire, USA
<sup>19
</sup>.
</li> 
<li>Bathymetric soundings contributed by the Institut Fran&ccedil;ais de Recherche pour L'Exploitation de la Mer (IFREMER) from centre beam data from over 100 cruises.
</li> 
<li>The Geological Survey of Ireland (GSI) provided a bathymetric grid for Irish designated waters based on multibeam surveys carried out between 2000 and 2006 as part of the Irish National Seabed Survey
<sup>12
</sup>.
</li> 
<li>In some shallow water areas (shallower than 300 m), bathymetry data have been provided by a number of the International Hydrographic Organization's (IHO) Member States. This work has been done through a project, coordinated by the International Hydrographic Bureau (IHB), to extract shallow water bathymetry data from Electronic Navigation Charts (ENCs).
</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Since the release of the first version of the GEBCO Grid in 2009, the data set has been updated with a number of bathymetric compilations as detailed in the 
<a href="#5_data" target="_self">data set update history
</a> section below.

</p> 
<h4 id="2.1_proced">2.1 Procedures used to update the GEBCO base grid
</h4> 
<p>The inclusion of new data sets into the existing GEBCO base grid has been done with the aim of producing a seamless global terrain model.
</p> 
<p>For the majority of the updates supplied in the form of bathymetric grids or multibeam surveys, the 'remove-restore' procedure (Smith and Sandwell, 1997; Becker, Sandwell and Smith, 2009 and Hell and Jakobsson, 2011) has been used.
</p> 
<p>This is a two stage process of computing the difference between the new data and the existing grid and then gridding the difference and adding the difference back to the existing base grid. The aim is to achieve a smooth transition between the 'new' and 'old' data sets with the minimum of perturbation of the existing base data set.
</p> 
<p>For new data sets supplied in the form of isolated soundings a grid has been produced from the data points using an adjustable tension continuous curvature surface gridding algorithm, i.e. 'surface' from Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) (Smith and Wessel, 1990).
</p> 
<h4 id="2.2_reported">2.2 Reporting bugs in the GEBCO Grid
</h4> 
<p>While every effort is made to produce an error free grid, some artefacts may still appear in the data set. Please see our errata web page for information on known bugs in the dataset
</p> 
<p>If you find any anomalies in the grid then please report them via email ( 
<a href='mailto:enquiries@bodc.ac.uk'>enquiries@bodc.ac.uk
</a> ), giving the problem location, and we will investigate.

<h3 id="3_land">3. Land data
</h3> 
<p>With the exception of polar regions, land data are based on the one km averages of topography derived from version 2.0 of the US Geological Survey SRTM30
<sup>25
</sup> gridded digital elevation model data product, created with data from the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Shuttle Radar Topography Mission.
</p> 
<p>For the Arctic region north of 64&deg; N the GEBCO grid is based on the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO) v3
<sup>17
</sup>. This data set uses land data taken largely from the Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 (GMTED2010)
<sup>5
</sup> data set. Over Greenland the approximately 2000 by 2000 m resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
<sup>8
</sup> published by Ekholm (1996) is used.
</p> 
<p>For the Southern Ocean area, south of 60&deg; S, land data are taken from Bedmap2
<sup>9
</sup> data set as included in the International Bathymetric Chart of the Southern Ocean (IBCSO)

<h3 id="6_format">6. Grid format
</h3> 
<p>GEBCO's gridded data sets are made available in netCDF, in the form of both two-dimensional (2D) and one-dimensional (1D) arrays of signed 2-byte integers. In addition, the 2D gridded data set uses the NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention ( 
<a href='http://cfconventions.org/'>http://cfconventions.org/
</a> ).
</p> 
<p>The 1D grid file format is aimed specifically for use with the 
<a href='http://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gebco_digital_atlas/'>GEBCO Digital Atlas software interface
</a> and 
<a href='http://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gebco_digital_atlas/'>GEBCO Grid Display software
</a>. 
<strong>Please note
</strong> that these software packages
<strong>will not work with the 2D grid format files
</strong> but solely with the global 1D grid files.
</p> 
<h4 id="6.1_GEBCO">6.1 2D CF-netCDF format
</h4> 
<p>Within the 2D CF-netCDF file, the grid is stored as a two-dimensional array of 2-byte signed integer values of elevation in metres, with negative values for bathymetric depths and positive values for topographic heights.
</p> 
<p>The complete data set gives global coverage, spanning 89&deg; 59' 45''N, 179&deg; 59' 45''W to 89&deg; 59' 45''S, 179&deg; 59' 45''E on a 30 arc-second grid. It consists of 21,600 rows x 43,200 columns, giving 933,120,000 data points. The netCDF storage is arranged as contiguous latitudinal bands. The data values are pixel-centre registered i.e. they refer to elevations at the centre of grid cells.
</p> 
<p>The data file includes header information which conforms to the NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention ( 
<a href='http://cfconventions.org/'>http://cfconventions.org/
</a> ).
</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Please note
</strong> that 2D grid format files will not work with either the GEBCO Digital Atlas software interface or the GEBCO Grid Display software package &mdash; these packages are designed to use the 1D version of GEBCO's grids. See the software packages and GEBCO's grids section below for further details on how the data may be viewed and accessed.
</p> 
<p> 
<a href="#content">Back to contents
</a> 
</p> 
<h4 id="6.2_GEBCO">6.2 1D netCDF format
</h4> 
<p>Within the 1D netCDF file, the grid is stored as a one-dimensional array of 2-byte signed integer values of elevation in metres, with negative values for bathymetric depths and positive values for topographic heights.
</p> 
<p>The complete data set gives global coverage. The grid consists of 21,600 rows x 43,200 columns, resulting in 933,120,000 data points. The data start at the Northwest corner of the file and are arranged in latitudinal bands of 360 degrees x 120 points per degree = 43,200 values. The data range eastward from 179&deg; 59' 45'' W to 179&deg; 59' 45'' E. Thus, the first band contains 43,200 values for 89&deg; 59' 45'' N, then followed by a band of 43,200 values at 89&deg; 59' 15'' N and so on at 30 arc second latitude intervals down to 89&deg; 59' 45'' S. The data values are pixel centre registered i.e. they refer to elevations at the centre of grid cells.
</p> 
<p>This grid file format is suitable for use with the GEBCO Digital Atlas Software Interface and GEBCO Grid display software and packages such as Generic Mapping Tools (GMT).
</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Please note
</strong> that for ease of import into Esri ArcGIS Desktop software packages it is suggested that the 2D versions of GEBCO's grids are used. However, through the GridViewer and GDA software interfaces the data can be exported in an ASCII form suitable for conversion to an Esri raster. See the software packages and GEBCO's grids section below for further details on how the data may be viewed and accessed.
</p> 
<h4 id="6.3_GEBCO">6.3 Esri ASCII raster format
</h4> 
<p>This is an ASCII format developed for the export/exchange of Esri ARC/INFO rasters. The 
<a href='http://resources.esri.com/help/9.3/arcgisengine/java/GP_ToolRef/spatial_analyst_tools/esri_ascii_raster_format.htm'>format
</a> consists of a header that gives the geographic extent and grid interval of the data set, followed by the actual grid cell data values.
</p> 
<h4 id="6.4_GEBCO">6.4 INT16 GeoTIFF
</h4> 
<p>The 
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoTIFF'>GeoTiff
</a> format contains geo-referencing (geographic extent and projection) information embedded within a Tiff file. The GEBCO_2014 Grid and SID grids are made available as single-channel INT16 (two byte signed integer) data values for user-defined areas in GeoTiff format.

</p> 
<h4 id="7_data">7. Software packages and GEBCO's grids
</h4> 
<p>GEBCO's grids can be used with a number of software packages and systems. The following are given as examples
</p> 
<h4 id="7.1_GEBCO">7.1 Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)
</h4> 
<p>Both GEBCO's 1D and 2D grids can be used with the GMT software system ( 
<a href='http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/'>http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/
</a> ). GMT is an open source collection of around 65 tools for manipulating geographic and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and producing image files from the data sets.
</p> 
<p> 
<a href="#content">Back to contents
</a> 
</p> 
<h4 id="7.2_GEBCO">7.2 Esri ArcGIS Desktop software packages
</h4> 
<p>For use of GEBCO's grids in Esri ArcGIS Desktop packages, such as ArcMap, it is possible to import the data in a number of ways.
</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Esri ASCII raster data sets can be converted to Esri rasters using Esri ArcToolbox routine 'ASCII to Raster' from the 'Conversion' Toolbox. Alternatively, Esri ASCII raster files can be added directly into ArcMap.
</li> 
<li>GeoTiff files can be added directly into ArcMap.
</li> 
<li>For GEBCO's grids in 2D form it is suggested that they are imported as a 'netCDF raster layer'. The 'make netCDF raster layer' routine can be found in the Multidimension toolbox in ArcToolbox. See Esri's web site for further details &mdash; 
<a href='http://resources.arcgis.com/en/home/'>http://resources.arcgis.com/en/home/
</a> 
</li> 
<li>For GEBCO's grids in 1D form you can use the GridViewer software interface ( 
<a href='http://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/grid_display_software/'>http://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/grid_display_software/
</a> ) to export the data in Esri ASCII raster format. See the accompanying software documentation for further details. Data in this form can be converted to an Esri raster using the ArcToolbox routine 'ASCII to Raster' from the Conversion Tools toolbox.

</a> 
</p> 
<h4 id="8_terms">8. GEBCO's grids and vertical datum
</h4> 
<p>GEBCO's global elevation models are generated by the assimilation of heterogeneous data types, assuming all of them to be referred to mean sea level. However, in some shallow water areas, the grids include data from sources having a vertical datum other than mean sea level. We are working to understand how best to fully assimilate these data.

</h3> 
<p> 
<strong>The GEBCO_2014 Grid is not to be used for Navigation or for any other purpose relating to safety at sea.
</strong> 
</p> 
<p>Information in the GEBCO_2014 Grid has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable but its accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed. While every effort has been made to ensure its reliability within the limits of present knowledge, no responsibility can be accepted by those involved in its compilation or publication for any consequential loss or damage arising from its use.
</p> 
<p>The GEBCO_2014 Grid is essentially a deep ocean product and does not include detailed bathymetry for shallow shelf waters. Even to the present day, most areas of the world's oceans have not been fully surveyed and, for the most part, bathymetric mapping is an interpretation based on random tracklines of data from many different sources. The quality and coverage of data from these sources is highly variable. Although the GEBCO_2014 Grid is presented at 30 arc second intervals of latitude and longitude, this does not imply that knowledge is available on sea floor depth at this resolution &mdash; the depth in most 30 arc second squares of the world's oceans has yet to be measured.

<strong>2002

</p> 
<h5>Data set information
</h5> 
<p>The grid was generated from over 280,000 bathymetric soundings and points digitised from bathymetric contours, taken from 107 Russian hydrographic charts, on a Mercator projection relative to the Pulkovo 1942 datum.
</p> 
<p>The digitised soundings and contour data were converted from Mercator projection co-ordinates to x,y,z values on a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection on the WGS 84 datum using Global Mapper software.
</p> 
<p>The data, in UTM co-ordinates, were then gridded using a kriging algorithm from Golden Software Inc's Surfer software package using 100 m interval grid spacing.
</p> 
<p>The 100 m interval UTM grid was converted to geographic co-ordinates, with grid intervals of three arc seconds. Due to the Caspian Sea's lower sea level stand, 28 m was added to the depths in the grid, using Global Mapper software. The data set was supplied to GEBCO at this resolution.
</p> 
<p>The grid was sampled to 30 arc second intervals using 'grdsample' from Generic Mapping Tools (GMT).
</p> 
<p>Quality control checks were carried out on the data set, looking for artefacts in the gridded data. This was done by comparing the gridded data set with the source sounding and contour data. Any artefacts noted in the grid were removed.
</p> 
<p>The Caspian Sea grid was then incorporated into the GEBCO_08 Grid. This was achieved by firstly extracting grid points (largely land elevation) from the GEBCO_08 Grid that fell outside the geographic coverage of the Caspian Sea grid. These data were converted to ASCII x,y,z values. An ASCII x,y,z file of data values was created from the Caspian Sea grid. The data sets were combined and then gridded at 30 arc second intervals using 'Surface' (a minimum tension surface gridding algorithm) from GMT.

<p>Further information about the BCWS is given on AWI's web site.
</p> 
<h4>Grid preparation
</h4> 
<p>The bathymetric contour data from the BCWS were gridded in Mercator projection co-ordinates. Firstly, a Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) grid was created from the contour lines using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm.
</p> 
<p>The TIN was converted to a grid with a regular cell spacing using Natural Neighbours interpolation with a cell size of 250m. The grid was then projected from Mercator to geographic coordinates with a cell size of 30 arc-seconds.

<h4>Data set information
</h4> 
<p>The IBCSO is terrain model for the Southern Ocean area south of 60&deg;S. It has been developed from a database of multibeam and single beam echo sounder data points &mdash; digitised soundings from nautical charts and regional bathymetric compilations. The data have been contributed by more than 30 institutions from 15 countries. Land and ice shelf regions are based on the Bedmap2 data sets.
</p> 
<p>Using the Bedmap2 data sets, the IBCSO grid is made available with a choice for land/ice shelf areas of either 'surface elevation', giving the surface elevation including ice cover, or 'bedrock', giving the surface elevation without ice cover. The data set is available at 500m grid intervals in Polar Stereographic projection units and also at one arc-minute grid intervals in geographic latitude and longitude co-ordinates.
</p> 
<p>Further information about the development of the data set can be found on the IBCSO web site &mdash; 
<a href='http://www.ibcso.org'>www.ibcso.org
</a> . Further information about Bedmap2 can be found on their web site &mdash; 
<a href='http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//bas_research/our_research/az/bedmap2/'>www.antarctica.ac.uk//bas_research/our_research/az/bedmap2/
</a> 
</p> 
<p>For consistency with the Arctic region, the 'surface elevation' version of the IBCSO grid was used to update the GEBCO grid.
</p> 
<p>The one arc minute interval version of the IBCSO grid was sampled to 30 arc seconds using GMT's grdsample software routine. The data were edge matched with the existing GEBCO grid at 60&deg; S using a feather blending routine, part of the Global Mapper v11.01 software package.

<h4>Data set information
</h4> 
<p>EMODnet is a project, funded by the European Commission, to bring together marine data into interoperable, continuous and publicly available data sets for complete maritime basins in European waters.
</p> 
<p>As part of this project, the EMODnet bathymetry portal provides bathymetry data in the form of Digital Terrain Models (DTM) for selected maritime basins. The DTMs have been produced from collated bathymetric data sets integrated into a central DTM. There are 'holes' in the central DTM in regions where high resolution data sets are not available.
</p> 
<p>Through a collaboration between GEBCO and the EMODnet bathymetry team, the 2013 version of the EMODnet grid has been incorporated into the GEBCO global grid using the 'remove-restore' procedure. This has resulted in a continuous grid with gaps filled by the existing GEBCO grid.
</p> 
<p>This combined grid has been included in GEBCO_2014 and forms the basis of future EMODnet bathymetric grid development work.
</p> 
<p>It is planned to continue the GEBCO and EMODnet collaboration work for future development of these data sets.

The synthesis began in 1992 as the Ridge Multibeam Synthesis (RMBS), was expanded to include multibeam bathymetry data from the Southern Ocean and now includes other bathymetry from throughout the global and coastal oceans.
</p> 
<p>LDEO have provided over 9,600 data tiles from their GMRT tile set (400 m resolution) for updating GEBCO's grid.
</p> 
<p>The data from the GMRT tile set has been included into the GEBCO grid using the remove-restore procedure.

<h4>Japan Coast Guard Grid for the North Western Pacific Ocean region
</h4> 
<p> 
<strong>Included in &mdash;
</strong> version 20141103 of the GEBCO_2014 Grid, released in November 2014
</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Data set coverage &mdash;
</strong> North Western Pacific Ocean area: 17&deg;N - 43&deg;N; 126&deg;E - 160&deg;E
</p> 
<p> 
<strong>Data set provided by &mdash;
</strong> Japan Oceanographic Data Center (JODC) of the Japan Coast Guard
</p> 
<h4>Data set information
</h4> 
<p>The grid for this area was originally developed at 9 arc-second intervals and based on the following source data
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>(1) Land data
</li> 
<li>(2) Multibeam data from the Japan Coast Guard
</li> 
<li>(3) A pre-prepared 500m interval grid based on measured sounding data: J-EGG500 grid JODC-Expert Grid data for Geographic -500m 
<a href='http://www.jodc.go.jp/data_set/jodc/jegg_intro.html'>www.jodc.go.jp/data_set/jodc/jegg_intro.html
</a> 
</li> 
<li>(4) GEBCO_08
</li> 
</ul> 
<img src="https://www.bodc.ac.uk/data/documents/nodb/images/301801AB.jpg" alt="BODC document image" /> 
<p>The gridded data set for the area was developed by combining the above data sources using the 'surface' gridding algorithm from Generic Mapping Tools (GMT). The areas where no multibeam data exists were filled with the J-EGG500 data (3) or with GEBCO_08 grid data (4) for the areas outside of the coverage of (3).
</p> 
<p>To avoid 'steps' between these data sets during the gridding process, 'buffering zones' were created around data sets (2) and (3). The buffer zone width was 1 km for the contact between (2) and (3), and 2 km for the contacts between (2) and (4) or between (3) and (4).
</p> 
<p>The values in the 'buffering zones' are interpolated, based on values from the surrounding gridded data sets. In addition, the relatively small data gaps between land values and multibeam data or within the area based on multibeam data were interpolated from nearby data.
</p> 
<p>The final grid was generated by sampling to 30 arc seconds using 'grdsample' from Generic Mapping Tools.
</p> 
<p>The data set has been included into the GEBCO grid using the remove-restore procedure.

</p> 
<h4>Data set information
</h4> 
<p>Data extracted from Electronic Navigation Charts (ENCs) has been provided by the East Asia Hydrographic Commission for part of the South China Sea region to help update the GEBCO_08 Grid. This is as part of an initiative to help improve GEBCO's grids in shallower water regions, bathymetry.
</p> 
<p>Over 12,200 soundings were provided with over 8,570 in waters of a depth of 200 m or shallower. The data set also contains bathymetric contours.
</p> 
<p>Sounding point data and data from some of the bathymetric contours in the depth region of 200 m and shallower were used to update the GEBCO grid. These data were combined with data extracted from the GEBCO grid (in regions deeper than 200 m) and gridded using an adjustable tension continuous curvature surface gridding algorithm, i.e. 'surface' from Generic Mapping Tools (GMT).

</p> 
<h4>Data set information
</h4> 
<p>At the end of 2012, a scientific cruise (survey code SS2012_v06) led by the University of Sydney in the Coral Sea region of the South Pacific Ocean reported that an island, &quot;Sandy Island&quot;, shown in some digital data sets, including the GEBCO_08 Grid, did not exist. Further information can be found on GEBCO's web site.
</p> 
<p>It is believed that the island has been incorporated into terrain models such as GEBCO via its inclusion in digital coastline data sets.
</p> 
<p>In order to correct this error in the GEBCO_08 Grid, the scientists who collected the data kindly made it available to GEBCO, via Geoscience Australia. To further help with this update work, the Australian Hydrographic Office provided data from some of their survey data sets for the region.
</p> 
<p>Using these data sources, this area of the GEBCO_08 Grid has been updated. The update work was carried out by gridding the newly supplied data using GMT's 'surface' gridding algorithm.
