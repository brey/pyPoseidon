------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:

1) No missing data allowed for first eight common fields.  Missing data for other fields are expected to be blank characters between the comma delimiters.  Although the files are not column dependent please insure that the proper number of blank characters is included in missing data so the columns line up.  This makes the files easier to read and troubleshoot.

2) The USERDEFINED sections are for inclusion of items not already in the common fields.  The USERDEFINED parameter is 20 characters, so there should be sufficient space to include some text describing what comes next.  There are currently five sets of these.

3) Wind records merged in from preexisting wind files (r-decks) were assigned a TECH of CNTR.  Wind records created during normal use of this combined data format are assigned the TECH corresponding to the center name as defined in $ATCFINC/atcfsite.nam.

4) WINDCODE and SEASCODE other than AAA, NEQ, SEQ, SWQ and NWQ exist in older data but have been deprecated.

5) RAD values of 100 exist in old data (earlier than 2005) but have been deprecated.  Currently only 34, 50 and 64 are valid for RAD.

6) The fields are not column dependent, but the files are easier to read and troubleshoot if the columns line up.  The fields are comma and space delimited.  

The desired field widths and preferred ATCF application ranges are as follows:
